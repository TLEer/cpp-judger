# cpp-judger
A CP program judger written in c++ (Work In Progress)

## Usage
./run [file_name] [compile_args]

## What I wanted to do

1. Compile and run

Compile program passes the name of testcases to the judger. If an error occured when compiling the source code, print CE and quit.

2. Judge

It determines how many testcases there are and redirects the input and output to file "input" and "answer". After the program being judged exited, it will compare the output with the correct answer.

## To-do

Memory-limit and time-limit

Error catching
